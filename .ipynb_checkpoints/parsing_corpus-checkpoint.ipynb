They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, it\\'s true, men hear a drill, it\\'s like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, \"Honey, I think Jim\\'s working on something over there.\" So they run over to the guy. Now they don\\'t actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. That\\'s what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, \"What are you using, a Phillips-head?\" You know, we feel involved. That\\'s why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that\\'s just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they don\\'t cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. \"What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, that\\'ll hold.\"',\n",
